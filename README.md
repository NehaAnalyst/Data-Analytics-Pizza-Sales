# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

## Overview  
Analyzed sales data for a pizza chain to identify trends, top-selling products, and customer behavior.  
**Objective:** Optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies using SQL and Excel.

## Tools Used  
- **SQL:** Data extraction, aggregation, and cleaning.  
- **Excel:** Advanced formulas (SUMIFS, VLOOKUP), pivot tables, and interactive dashboards.  
- **Visualization:** Charts (bar graphs, heatmaps) to highlight sales performance.  

## Key Insights  
- Identified **top 5 best-selling pizzas** contributing to 28% of total revenue.  
- Discovered **peak sales hours** (12 PM–2 PM, 6 PM–8 PM) for targeted promotions.  
- Recommended renegotiating supplier contracts for low-selling pizza categories.
